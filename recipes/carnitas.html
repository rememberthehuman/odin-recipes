        <h3>Carnitas are simply Mexican pulled pork.</h3>
        <p>The traditional way of making carnitas is to cook pork shoulder slowly in a large pot filled with lard until the meat is tender and crispy on the outside.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>6-8 lb bone-in pork shoulder roast</li>
                <li>2 cups beer or chicken stock</li>
                <li>1 yellow onion, peeled and roughly chopped</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon minced garlic</li>                
                <li>4 chipotle peppers in adobo, minced</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoon ground oregano</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>                
                <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon salt+plus more for sprinkling</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>    
        
        <ol>
            <li>Put the pork roast into the bowl of an Instant Pot or Slow Cooker.</li>
            <li>Dump all of the remaining ingredients into a large bowl, whisk to combine, then pour over the pork roast.</li>
            <li>To cook in a Slow Cooker (or using the slow cooker setting on an Instant Pot): Cover and cook on low for 8-9 hours, or on high for 6-7 hours, until the roast is extremely tender and falling apart.</li>
            <li>To cook in an Instant Pot: Pressure Cook on high pressure for 2 hours and 30 minutes, then 15 minutes natural release. After 15 minutes, release the remaining pressure by turning the Venting Knob to venting position. Remove the lid carefully.</li>
            <li>Set the cooked pork roast on a large platter or cutting board and let rest until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Pour the cooking liquid through a strainer into a bowl. Discard solids and reserve the liquid.</li>
            <li>Place a rack in the top position of your oven and preheat the broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Using a couple of forks, shred the pork roast, removing the bone and any super fatty pieces. Spread the pork out into a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Drizzle about 1 & Â½ cups of the reserved cooking liquid over the pork. Sprinkle with about 1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>Place the pan under the broiler and cook for 5 minutes, until the edges of the pieces of pork begin to brown and crisp. Remove from the oven, and use metal tongs or two large spoons to toss pieces around on the sheet. If there is little to no liquid on the bottom of the pan, douse with a bit more. Spread out into an even layer and put the pan back under the broiler for another 5 minutes until more of the pork edges are brown and crispy.</li>
            <li>Taste! Sprinkle salt to desired levels.</li>
        </ol>
